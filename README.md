# Green Restaurant
*Green Restaurant is a fictional website project and is visible at this adress*:
- [Green Restaurant](https://green-music-restaurant.herokuapp.com/)

> **Note**: In this place, you can eat healthy food thanks to the provision of dishes composed by various and varied foods, respecting the seasonality of the products. We work exclusively with local producers to highlight the products of our region and which also allow us to obtain the lowest carbon footprint.

## <a id="setup">Project setup</a>
1. Download the project by using the command line<br/> 
**"git clone https://github.com/Emptik/green-music-restaurant.git"**<br/>
or the .zip folder.
2. Install npm globally. A good solution on windows is to download the [nodeJs installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).<br/>
NPM is include with nodeJs. Then, inside the root project folder type the command line **"npm ci"**.
3. Install composer globally, a good solution on windows is to download the [composer installer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).<br/>
Then inside the root project folder type the command line **"composer update"**.
4. Install [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install) globally.<br/>
For doing that, type the command line **"npm install -g sass"**.<br/>
Then i recommend you to compile your scss files by typing the command line **"sass --watch sass:css"** inside the public folder of the project.

> **Note**: In the root folder you will see several configuration files like,<br/>
".eslintrc.js", ".stylelintrc.json".
They are useful if you want to use some linters, that i recommend you to use.<br/>
See the part [Useful links](#usefulLinks) down of this page.

## <a id="scssMethodology">Scss methodology</a>
> **Note**: I followed the BEM methodology for writing scss rules.<br/>
Nevertheless, some differences are to be noted. For that, read the section below.

As i said, components and layout rules are written with the BEM syntax.<br/>
Please, use "camelCase" when you write your class name.

The syntax used for this project is as follow:
- `.blockName`
- `.blockName--modifierName`
- `.blockName__elementName`
- `.blockName__elementName--modifierName`

> **Note**: A modifier can never be alone on a single dom node. He is always attached to a block or to his element.<br/>
External geometry is not allowed on a block component (Prefer padding instead of margin), but is allowed on his element.
However, it is possible to use some external geometry on a block, if this one is a part of the layout.

On this project, contrary to the recommendations of the BEM documentation,<br/>
it is not possible to have a block and an element on a single dom node.

**Exemple**:

```
<div class="c-header">
    <div class="c-searchForm c-header__searchForm"></div>
</div>
```

> **Note**: In BEM, this is called a [mix](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/#mixes) but it's not allowed on this project.

**Instead prefer**:

```
<div class="c-header">
    <div class="c-header__searchForm">
        <div class="c-searchForm"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

> **Note**: Use a prefix before your class name, like "c-" if it is a component or l- for a layout rule.

## <a id="scssFolders">Scss folders</a>
> **Note**: Scss files are organized inside folders with a SMACSS logical storage.<br/>
Nevertheless, some differences are to be noted. For that, read the section below.

### Base
The base folder contain the base rules.<br/>
They define the default style of an element for all its appearances on the page.<br/>
Don't forget that most of the parts of a website may change in the futur, so use them sparingly.<br/>
A base file should stay minimalist.

Allowed selectors are:
- Type selector (`input`)
- Selector list (`div, span`)
- Descendant combinator (`div span`)
- Child combinator (`ul > li`)
- Attribute selector (`input[type=text]`)
- Adjacent sibling combinator (`h2 + p`)
- Pseudo classes (`a:visited`)

Forbidden selectors:
- Class (`.className`)
- Id (`#idName`)

> **Note**: The normalize or reset scss file goes in this folder.

### Layout
The layout folder contain the layout rules.<br/>
They divide the page in different section.<br/>
They hold one or several components together.<br/>
They are never include inside the components. They encapsulate them.<br/>
Use the prefix (`l-`) follow by the name of your class to indicate that this is a layout rule.

The only one selector allowed:
- Class selector (`.l-header`)

> **Note**: Contrary to the SMACSS documentation, it is not possible to use an ID selector to target an dom element<br/>
if you wish to add some layout rules.

### Components
The component rules are reusable, they are the modular parts of your design.<br/>
This is the biggest part of your scss rules.<br/>
Use the prefix (`c-`) follow by the name of your class to indicate that this is a component rule.

The only one selector allowed:
- Class selector (`.c-form`)

### State
The state folder doesn't exist in this project<br/>
The BEM modifiers are in charge of this role.

## <a id="javascript">Javascript</a>
Javascript is used on the front-end side with an MVC approach. The latest JS syntax is allowed.<br/>
Controllers are listed in a single file.<br/>
Classes are present for the view part. Each class correspond to a component.<br/>
I recommend you to use ESlint with the Airbnb config file. More information in the Useful links part below.
